# DOH-COVID-19-Data-Drop-Analysis
Provides automation for the analysis and representation of data in the latest Department of Health COVID-19 Data Drop in the Philippines.

The following are the fully functional Python program in this repository:
  DOHCaseInfo.py - Determines the number of total COVID-19 cases based on health status and residence
  SevenDaysCases.py - Almost similar with DOHCaseInfo.py but only take into account the cases for the past seven days
